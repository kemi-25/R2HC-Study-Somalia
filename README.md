Cash Plus Interventions for Preventing Child Wasting in Somalia: Analysis Code

Study Overview
This repository contains the analysis code for a cluster-randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different cash assistance strategies for preventing acute malnutrition in Somalia. The study was conducted from May 2023 to January 2024 in Bay and Hiran regions, areas experiencing high rates of food insecurity and child wasting.

Study Design
Type: Cluster-randomized controlled trial with adaptive design
Setting: Two high-burden districts in Somalia (Bay and Hiran)
Duration: 6-month intervention period with 9-month total study period
Sample: 1,490 households with 1,894 children under 5 years

Intervention Arms
Arm 1 (Control): Cash assistance only - monthly transfers for 6 months
Arm 2: Cash + Social and Behavior Change Communication (SBCC) - monthly transfers plus nutrition education and counseling

Child wasting (measured by MUAC, weight-for-height z-scores, and edema)
Maternal wasting (measured by MUAC)

Methodology
The study employed a mixed-methods approach combining:
•	Quantitative household surveys and anthropometric measurements
•	Qualitative focus group discussions and key informant interviews
